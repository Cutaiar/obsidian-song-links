For those that get inspired to write by music, a small plugin connecting Spotify to [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).

Adds an `Insert song link` command to the palette which inserts a link to the song currently playing on your Spotify. [Demo](https://youtu.be/GaOau4shOQI)

Of course the plugin is free, but if you'd like to support me, I greatly appreciate it.
