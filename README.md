# Obsidian Spotify Links

> ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you to the ~70 users who have downloaded this plugin.

> ‚ùóÔ∏è We are waiting on a [Quota Extension](https://github.com/Cutaiar/obsidian-spotify-links/issues/5) from Spotify to make it publicly available. Until then I can manually authorize your account. Please reach out to me at [`dmcutaiar@gmail.com`](mailto:dmcutaiar@gmail.com).

For those that get inspired to write by music, a small plugin connecting Spotify to [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).

Adds an `Insert song link` command to the palette which inserts a link to the song currently playing on your Spotify. [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzs3ssqKk2Y)

Of course the plugin is free, but if you'd like to support me, I greatly appreciate it.
