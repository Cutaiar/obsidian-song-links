> [!WARNING]
> Thank you to the ~2000 users who have downloaded this plugin ❤️

> We are waiting on a [Quota Extension](https://github.com/Cutaiar/obsidian-song-links/issues/5) from Spotify to make the plugin publicly available. Until then, early adopters are appreciated – I can manually authorize your account. Reach out to me at [`dmcutaiar@gmail.com`](mailto:dmcutaiar@gmail.com).

For those that get inspired to write by music, a small plugin connecting Spotify to [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).

Adds an `Insert song link` command to the palette which inserts a link to the song currently playing on your Spotify. [Demo](https://youtu.be/GaOau4shOQI)

Of course the plugin is free, but if you'd like to support me, I greatly appreciate it.
